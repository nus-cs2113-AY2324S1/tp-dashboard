This allows every command we write in the future to be guaranteed to possess all methods specified in the superclass. Therefore, we can call these methods in our main function without needing to worry about the differences between various commands because they all inherit from the same parent. Another alternative we considered was simply making each separate command its own function and calling them from our parser class. However, we want to keep the commands as high level as possible and avoid calling more lower-level functions if possible, so we can provide more encapsulation to each command.
